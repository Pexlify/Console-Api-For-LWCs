This is a helper LWC which uses the Aura Component consoleApi and a message channel to give LWCs access to many of the Console functions which arenâ€™t available in LWCs. This can be implemented in 2 different ways.

Have a wrapper Aura Component with the LWCs within it along with the console utils as a child component.

When using a lightning page simply place the component on the page and it will not be Visible

Required Components:

consoleApi Message Channel

consoleApi Aura Component

consoleUtils LWC

## Set Up 

Import the required functions eg.    import {openSubtabUrl} from 'c/consoleUtils'

In any LWC you wish to use the functions you must have wired in the message context as follows.

import {  MessageContext } from 'lightning/messageService';   

@wire(MessageContext)messageContext
